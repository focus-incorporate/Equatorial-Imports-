# Equatorial Imports Coffee

A small Next.js site showcasing premium coffee capsules. The site now includes separate pages for product details and sustainability information.

## Usage
Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
Navigate to `/products` for the coffee lineup and `/sustainability` to learn about our eco-friendly practices.

## Project Structure
- `pages/` – Next.js pages (`index`, `products`, `sustainability`)
- `data/products.js` – coffee capsule data used by the product listing page
- `styles/` – global stylesheet
- `daniels.txt` – text extracted from the supplier PDF used for product descriptions
- `viaggio.txt` – notes transcribed from the "Viaggio Espresso New Lineup" presentation

This project uses React via Next.js for an easy development workflow.
